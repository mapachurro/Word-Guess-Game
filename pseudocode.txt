HANGMAN HOTH: ICE PLANET

Object of the Game: Guess what word is hidden in the empty spaces.

Gameplay: You play by guessing the letters, typing them on the keyboard. When you guess correctly, the spaces that have the letter that you guessed will be revealed.
However, when you guess incorrectly, one of your seven incorrect guesses is eliminated: one guess each for head, torso, each arm, each leg -- and your lightsaber, your
last-ditch chance at saving yourself from being TORN LIMB FROM LIMB BY THE WAMPA.

Remember, the fate of the Rebellion literally hangs in the balance -- literally.
